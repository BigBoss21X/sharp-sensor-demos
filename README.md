## Demo programs showing how to use Sharp sensors with Arduino

The purpose of this repository is to help Arduino users get started with using sensor components from Sharp Corporation. You may know Sharp as the maker of consumer electronics products such as flatscreen TVs, calculators, and smartphones. But Sharp also manufactures optoelectronic components and sensors which are widely used by other companies to build their own products such as air purifiers, robotic vacuums, automatic faucets, and much more.

For each sensor, you will find a demo program (sketch) for use with Arduino and a corresponding wiki application guide. The guide gives you some background information on the sensor and shows you how to get started. The Arduino programs are demonstrations which show you the basic steps. They aren't intended to be used for production purposes.

Everything in this repository is based on information which is already publicly available through various datasheets, specifications, and documents published by Sharp or their suppliers and distributors. I'm basically just summarizing things to help electronics hobbyists, researchers, and engineers get started more efficiently. I'll also be focusing more on the newer sensor models from Sharp.
