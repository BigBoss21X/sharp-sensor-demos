<h3>Demo programs showing how to use Sharp sensors with Arduino</h3>

The purpose of this repository is to help Arduino users get started with using sensor components from Sharp Corporation. You may know Sharp as the maker of consumer products such as LCD TVs. But Sharp also manufactures semiconductor components and sensors which are  widely used by other companies for their own products such as air purifiers, robotic vacuums, automatic faucets, and much more.

For each sensor, you will find a demo program (sketch) for use with Arduino and a corresponding application guide. The guide gives you some background information on the sensor and shows you how to get started. The Arduino programs are demonstrations which show you the basic steps. They aren't intended to be used for production purposes.
